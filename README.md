Once you have hosted your rules, you can submit the URL on https://search.brave.com/goggles/create. 

Brave Search will then fetch, validate and cache your Goggle internally so that it can be used while searching. In case the Goggle cannot be fetched, or is not valid, you will get some feedback in the page.
